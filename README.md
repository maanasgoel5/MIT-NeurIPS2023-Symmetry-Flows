## Project Overview

Likelihood-free inference using normalizing flows is a popular method for parameter estimation, but it faces computational challenges when dealing with symmetries in the data, such as time translation. This is a hurdle for analyzing un-modeled gravitational-wave signals, where parameters like frequency and duration are often more critical than the precise arrival time of a signal in a given data segment.

This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept solution by building a normalizing flow that is conditioned on a **symmetry-informed embedding network**. This pre-trained network learns to be agnostic to time shifts, allowing the main flow to focus on the intrinsic parameters of the signal (e.g., natural frequency and damping coefficient).

The key results show that this method leads to **faster convergence with a smaller, more efficient model** compared to a traditional normalizing flow that is not aware of such symmetries. While this work uses simplified physical models (Damped Harmonic Oscillators and Sine-Gaussians), it establishes a promising framework for real-world applications in gravitational-wave parameter estimation.
